# CS576-Tetris-Sample

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?


Apologies for the mess. YMMV.

My change to the game is passing on int by reference, if a line was eliminated, change that int and if the int is changed, change enemy's piece the same as mypiece.
However, I haven't solve the could not connect problem yet, this has not been tested.
